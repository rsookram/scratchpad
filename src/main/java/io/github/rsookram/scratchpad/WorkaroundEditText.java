/**
 * A customized {@link EditText} which works around a bug in scrolling the
 * cursor into position.
 *
 * When the IME wasn't shown, tapping on text would bring it up. If the text
 * that was tapped on was not on the last line, the parent ScrollView wouldn't
 * scroll to bring the selection into view. This was problematic when the IME
 * covered the selection, since it would force the user to manually scroll to
 * bring it into view.
 *
 * This was happening because EditText doesn't account for bottom padding when
 * specifying where the selection is, unless it's part of the last line.
 * Normally this isn't an issue since bottom padding tends to be similar in
 * height to a line of text. In this app however, bottom padding is added to
 * the EditText to adjust for system insets. So the padding can be as large as
 * the IME.
